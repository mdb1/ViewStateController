# ViewStateController

ViewStateController is a framework for Swift and SwiftUI developers that provides a simple and flexible way to manage the state of views that load information from a backend. It allows you to handle different states based on a historical array of states, and provides properties and methods to help you access and modify the state. With ViewStateController, you can easily implement complex views that depend on asynchronous data loading, and create a better user experience by showing loading spinners or error messages.
